# BUFF: Decomposed Bounded Floats for Fast Compression and Queries
A rust implementation of float compression for [paper](http://vldb.org/pvldb/vol14/p2586-liu.pdf) 

## BUFF compression not only reduces storage requirements but also enhances query performance:

Fast compression throughput and better compression ratio.

Query-friendly compression (fast filtering and aggregation execution).

Adaptive SIMD acceleration.

Supporting materialization with variable precision as requested.

Approximate query processing.

Outlier handling.
